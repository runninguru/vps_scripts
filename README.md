# vps_scripts
Scripts I use to manage Nginx on my Vultr VPS. This is designed to work with the One-Click LEMP application setup: https://www.vultr.com/docs/one-click-lemp

It includes scripts for the VIM setup I use, as well as managing website deployment via Nginx. I have not included anything for implementing security. This is designed to manage functionality alone.
